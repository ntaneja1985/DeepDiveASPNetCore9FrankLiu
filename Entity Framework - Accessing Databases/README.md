# Why Use Entity Framework Core?

## Overview

Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is an **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)** that simplifies database interactions in modern .NET applications. It acts as an abstraction layer between the application's C\# objects and the relational database, automating many of the tedious and error-prone tasks associated with raw database access.

## The Problem with Raw ADO.NET

Using ADO.NET directly gives developers full control but comes at the cost of significant manual effort and boilerplate code. For a single query, a developer must:

* **Manage Connections**: Manually create, open, and properly dispose of database connection objects.
* **Write Raw SQL**: Write SQL queries as strings, which can be prone to errors and SQL injection vulnerabilities if not handled carefully.
* **Handle Commands and Parameters**: Create command objects, manually add each parameter with its correct type and value, and manage the object's lifecycle.
* **Process Results Manually**: Iterate through a data reader and convert each column from the result set into the corresponding property of a C\# object. This is repetitive and tedious.

This "plumbing" code distracts from the primary goal of implementing business logic.

## The Solution: ORM and Entity Framework Core

An ORM like Entity Framework Core solves these problems by automating the data access layer. Instead of writing low-level data access code, developers can:

* **Work with Objects**: Interact with the database using familiar C\# classes and objects.
* **Use LINQ**: Write queries using Language-Integrated Query (LINQ), which EF Core translates into optimized SQL for the target database.
* **Focus on Business Logic**: EF Core handles connection management, command creation, parameterization, and data mapping automatically. The developer can focus on the application's logic rather than the mechanics of database communication.


## Comparison: ADO.NET vs. Entity Framework Core

| Feature | ADO.NET | Entity Framework Core |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Querying** | Raw SQL strings | LINQ to Entities (in C\#) |
| **Connection Management** | Manual (open, close, dispose) | Automatic |
| **Object Mapping** | Manual (from data reader) | Automatic |
| **Boilerplate Code** | High | Low |
| **Developer Focus** | Data access "plumbing" | Business Logic |

In summary, Entity Framework Core is the recommended data access technology for most ASP.NET Core applications because it dramatically increases developer productivity, reduces the potential for errors, and allows for more maintainable and readable code by abstracting away the complexities of direct database interaction.


# How Entity Framework Core Works

## Overview

This video provides a conceptual overview of how Entity Framework (EF) Core functions as an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM). It bridges the gap between the object-oriented C\# code in an application and the relational data stored in a database through a set of key components and processes.

## Core Concepts and Components

### 1) Entities

- **Definition**: Entities are the plain C\# classes in your application that represent the data you want to store.
- **Mapping**: Each entity class typically maps to a single database table, and the properties of the class map to the columns in that table. Relationships between classes (e.g., a `Customer` having many `Orders`) are mapped to relationships between tables (e.g., foreign keys).


### 2) DbContext

- **Definition**: The `DbContext` is the central class in EF Core. It represents a session with the database and acts as the primary gateway for all database operations.
- **Responsibilities**:
    - **Database Representation**: Conceptually, it represents the entire database. It contains `DbSet<T>` properties for each entity, where each `DbSet<T>` represents a table.
    - **Querying**: It is used to query data from the database using LINQ.
    - **Saving Changes**: It coordinates writing changes (inserts, updates, deletes) back to the database.


### 3) Change Tracker

- **Definition**: The change tracker is a built-in mechanism within the `DbContext` that automatically keeps track of the state of every entity that the context is aware of.
- **How it Works**:

1. When you query for data, the retrieved entities are loaded into the `DbContext` and are in an **`Unchanged`** state.
2. If you modify a property of an entity, the change tracker automatically updates its state to **`Modified`**. Similarly, new entities are marked as **`Added`** and removed ones as **`Deleted`**.
3. When you call the `SaveChanges()` method on the `DbContext`, it inspects the change tracker to see which entities have been added, modified, or deleted.
4. Based on these states, EF Core automatically generates and executes the appropriate SQL `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements.


### 4) Migrations

- **Definition**: Migrations are a feature used to manage and evolve the database schema over time, keeping it synchronized with your application's entity classes (the data model).
- **How it Works**:

1. When you change your entity classes (e.g., add a new property, remove a property, or change a data type), you create a new migration.
2. The EF Core tools compare your updated C\# model with the last known state of the database schema.
3. A new migration file is generated containing C\# code that describes the necessary SQL commands to update the database schema to match the new model.
4. You then "apply" the migration, which executes these commands against the database.

| **DbContext** | It is the central hub for all database interactions. It manages the database connection, queries data, and saves changes. | "The `DbContext` represents a session with the database. I use it to query data via its `DbSet` properties and to persist changes back to the database using the `SaveChanges` method." |
| **Entities** | These are the domain objects of the application. EF Core's "code-first" approach allows the database schema to be driven by the definition of these C\# classes. | "My entities are the C\# classes that define my data model. EF Core maps these classes to database tables, allowing me to work with strongly-typed objects instead of raw SQL." |
| **Change Tracking** | This is the "magic" that allows EF Core to automatically generate SQL. It frees the developer from manually writing `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements. | "The change tracker is a key feature of the `DbContext`. It automatically detects modifications I make to my entities and translates them into the correct SQL commands when I call `SaveChanges`." |
| **Migrations** | This feature provides a robust, source-controlled way to manage database schema changes, which is essential for team-based development and CI/CD pipelines. | "I use EF Core Migrations to manage my database schema. It allows me to evolve the database structure in a controlled, versioned way that stays in sync with my application's code." |

# Installing Entity Framework Core NuGet Packages

## Overview

This video walks through the essential NuGet packages required to integrate Entity Framework (EF) Core into an ASP.NET Core Web API project. The goal is to replace an in-memory data store with a persistent database, specifically targeting SQL Server.

## Required NuGet Packages

To use EF Core with SQL Server and enable database migrations, four key packages must be installed:


| NuGet Package | Purpose |
| :-- | :-- |
| **`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`** | This is the core EF Core library. It provides all the fundamental functionalities of the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), including the `DbContext`, change tracking, and LINQ to Entities translation. |
| **`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`** | This is the database provider for SQL Server. It contains the specific logic required for EF Core to communicate with a Microsoft SQL Server database, translate LINQ queries into T-SQL, and manage connections. |
| **`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools`** | This package contains the command-line tools for EF Core. It enables design-time tasks, most notably creating and applying migrations from the Package Manager Console or the .NET CLI. |
| **`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`** | This package provides the necessary design-time services that the tools package relies on. It allows the tools to discover and instantiate your `DbContext` to generate migrations. |

## Key Takeaways

- **Core vs. Provider**: `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` is the main package, while a specific provider package like `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` is needed for each type of database you want to connect to.
- **Tooling for Migrations**: The `Tools` and `Design` packages are not required for the application to run, but they are essential for the development workflow, specifically for managing the database schema with migrations.
- **Installation**: All packages can be installed through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio or via the .NET command-line interface (CLI). After installation, they will be listed as dependencies in the project's `.csproj` file.

With these packages installed, the project is now equipped to define a `DbContext`, configure a connection to a SQL Server database, and manage the database schema using EF Core Migrations.


# Setting Up the DbContext in Entity Framework Core

## Overview

This video explains how to create and configure a `DbContext` class in Entity Framework Core. The `DbContext` serves as an in-memory representation of the database, defining the tables, relationships, and initial data that will eventually be created in the physical database through migrations.

## Key Steps and Concepts

### 1) Creating the `DbContext` Class

- **Purpose**: The `DbContext` class is the central component in EF Core that represents a session with the database.
- **Implementation**: Create a new class (e.g., `CompanyDbContext`) that inherits from the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext` base class.


### 2) Defining Tables with `DbSet<T>`

- **Purpose**: To represent tables in the database, you add `DbSet<T>` properties to your `DbContext`. Each `DbSet<T>` corresponds to a table, and the generic type `T` is the entity class that maps to that table's structure.
- **Convention**: Property names for `DbSet` are typically plural (e.g., `Departments`, `Employees`).

```csharp
public class CompanyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Department> Departments { get; set; }
    public DbSet<Employee> Employees { get; set; }
}
```


### 3) Configuring Relationships with the Fluent API

- **Purpose**: While EF Core can infer simple relationships by convention, complex relationships (like one-to-many) should be configured explicitly for clarity and control. This is done by overriding the `OnModelCreating` method in the `DbContext`.
- **`OnModelCreating`**: This method is called by EF Core when it is building the initial in-memory model of the database. It provides a `ModelBuilder` instance that you use to configure your entities.
- **Fluent API**: The `ModelBuilder` offers a chainable, "fluent" API to define relationships, primary keys, foreign keys, and other database constraints.


### 4) Setting Up a One-to-Many Relationship

- **Navigation Properties**: First, ensure your entity classes have navigation properties to represent the relationship (e.g., a `Department` class should have a `List<Employee>` property, and an `Employee` class should have a `Department` property).
- **Fluent API Configuration**:
    - `HasMany()`: Specifies the "one" side of the relationship has a collection of the "many" side.
    - `WithOne()`: Specifies the "many" side has a single reference back to the "one" side.
    - `HasForeignKey()`: Explicitly defines which property in the "many" side's entity is the foreign key.

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Department>()
        .HasMany(d => d.Employees) // A Department has many Employees
        .WithOne(e => e.Department) // An Employee has one Department
        .HasForeignKey(e => e.DepartmentId); // The foreign key is DepartmentId
}
```


### 5) Seeding Initial Data

- **Purpose**: You can use the `ModelBuilder` to seed the database with initial, or "seed," data. This data will be inserted into the tables when the database is first created.
- **`HasData()` Method**: The `HasData()` method is used on an entity configuration to provide a collection of initial data.

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    // ... relationship configuration

    modelBuilder.Entity<Department>().HasData(
        new Department { DepartmentId = 1, Name = "HR" },
        new Department { DepartmentId = 2, Name = "IT" }
    );
}
```

| **`DbContext`** | It's the primary class for interacting with the database. It defines the database model and acts as a gateway for all operations. | "The `DbContext` is central to EF Core. I define my tables as `DbSet` properties within it and override `OnModelCreating` to configure the model." |
| **`DbSet<T>`** | This represents a table in the database and is the entry point for querying and saving entities of a specific type. | "Each `DbSet<T>` in my `DbContext` maps to a database table and allows me to perform CRUD operations on that table using LINQ." |
| **Fluent API** | It provides a powerful, code-based way to configure every aspect of the database model, overriding or supplementing the default conventions. | "For configuring complex relationships and constraints, I use the Fluent API inside the `OnModelCreating` method. It gives me fine-grained control over the database schema." |
| **Navigation Properties** | These properties on entity classes define the relationships between them and allow for easy traversal and loading of related data. | "I use navigation properties, like a `List<Order>` on a `Customer` entity, to define relationships. EF Core uses these properties to generate joins and load related data." |
| **Data Seeding** | This is the standard practice for populating a database with essential initial data, such as lookup values or default administrative accounts. | "I use the `HasData()` method in `OnModelCreating` to seed my database. This ensures that essential data is always present when the database is created, which is great for lookup tables or initial setup." |


# Connecting EF Core to a SQL Server Database

## Overview

This video demonstrates the essential steps for connecting an Entity Framework (EF) Core `DbContext` to a live SQL Server database. This involves creating a connection string, storing it securely in the application's configuration, and registering the `DbContext` with the dependency injection container, providing it with the necessary connection information.

## Key Steps and Concepts

### 1) Obtain the Database Connection String

- **Purpose**: The connection string contains all the information EF Core needs to find and connect to your SQL Server instance and the specific database.
- **Using Server Explorer**: You can use the **Server Explorer** in Visual Studio to establish a connection to your SQL Server instance.
    - Provide the server name (e.g., `(localdb)\mssqllocaldb` or `.` for a local instance).
    - Select the authentication method (Windows Authentication or SQL Server Authentication).
    - Once connected, you can view the properties of the connection to find the auto-generated connection string.
- **Important Settings**:
    - `Initial Catalog`: This specifies the name of the database you want to connect to. Even if the database doesn't exist yet, you should define its future name here.
    - `TrustServerCertificate=True`: This setting is often required when connecting to a local SQL Server instance that uses a self-signed certificate.


### 2) Store the Connection String in `appsettings.json`

- **Purpose**: Connection strings contain sensitive information and should not be hard-coded in your application. Storing them in `appsettings.json` (or more securely, in user secrets for development) is the standard practice.
- **Implementation**: Add a `ConnectionStrings` section to your `appsettings.Development.json` file and give your connection string a descriptive name.

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "CompanyManagement": "Server=(local);Database=CompanyManagement;User Id=sa;Password=your_password;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
  }
}
```


### 3) Register the `DbContext` with Dependency Injection

- **Purpose**: To make your `DbContext` available throughout your application (e.g., in your repositories or controllers), you must register it with ASP.NET Core's dependency injection (DI) container.
- **Implementation**:
    - In `Program.cs`, use the `builder.Services.AddDbContext<T>()` method.
    - Provide your `DbContext` class as the generic type `T` (e.g., `AddDbContext<CompanyDbContext>`).
    - Configure the options to use SQL Server (`options.UseSqlServer()`) and pass it the connection string retrieved from your configuration.

```csharp
// In Program.cs
var connectionString = builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("CompanyManagement");

builder.Services.AddDbContext<CompanyDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString)
);
```


### 4) Configure the `DbContext` Constructor

- **Purpose**: The `DbContext` needs to receive the configuration options (including the connection string) that you set up in `Program.cs`.
- **Implementation**: Add a constructor to your `DbContext` class that accepts a `DbContextOptions<T>` parameter and passes it to the `base` constructor. The DI container will automatically provide these options when it creates an instance of your `DbContext`.

```csharp
// In CompanyDbContext.cs
public class CompanyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public CompanyDbContext(DbContextOptions<CompanyDbContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    // ... your DbSets and OnModelCreating
}
```

| **Connection String** | It is the essential piece of configuration that tells EF Core how to locate and authenticate with your database. | "I store my connection strings in `appsettings.json` under the `ConnectionStrings` section and retrieve them in `Program.cs` using `builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString()`." |
| **`AddDbContext`** | This is the standard method for registering your `DbContext` with the DI container, making it available for injection throughout the application. | "I register my `DbContext` in `Program.cs` using `AddDbContext` and configure it to use a specific database provider, like `UseSqlServer`, passing in the connection string." |
| **`DbContextOptions`** | These options are used to configure the behavior of the `DbContext`, most importantly to provide it with the database connection information. | "My `DbContext` has a constructor that accepts `DbContextOptions` and passes them to the base class. This allows the DI container to inject the configured options, including the connection string." |
| **Configuration vs. Hard-coding** | Storing configuration like connection strings externally in `appsettings.json` or user secrets allows the application to be deployed to different environments without code changes. | "I never hard-code connection strings. I always load them from configuration, which allows me to easily switch between a local development database and a production database." |


# Running Database Migrations in Entity Framework Core

## Overview

This video demonstrates how to use Entity Framework (EF) Core Migrations to create and update a database schema based on a `DbContext` model. Migrations are a way to take the "in-memory" representation of your database (your C\# entity classes and `DbContext` configuration) and apply it to a physical database, creating tables, columns, and relationships automatically.

## Key Steps and Concepts

### 1) Creating the Initial Migration

- **Purpose**: The first step is to generate a migration file. This file contains C\# code that describes the SQL commands needed to create the database schema from scratch.
- **Package Manager Console**: Migrations are managed using commands in the **Package Manager Console** in Visual Studio.
- **Command**: `Add-Migration <MigrationName>`
    - Replace `<MigrationName>` with a descriptive name for your migration (e.g., `InitialCreate`).
    - When this command is run, EF Core inspects your `DbContext` and compares it to the last known state (or an empty state for the first migration). It then generates a migration file.


### 2) Understanding the Migration File

- A new folder named `Migrations` is created in your project, containing the migration files.
- Each migration file contains a class that inherits from `Migration` and has two important methods:
    - `Up()`: This method contains the code to apply the changes to the database. For an initial migration, this includes creating tables, defining columns, setting up primary and foreign keys, and inserting any seed data.
    - `Down()`: This method contains the code to revert the changes. This is used if you need to roll back a migration. For an initial migration, this typically involves dropping the tables.


### 3) Applying the Migration to the Database

- **Purpose**: After the migration file is generated, you must "apply" it to the database to execute the SQL commands and create the schema.
- **Command**: `Update-Database <MigrationName>`
    - Running this command will execute the `Up()` method of the specified migration.
    - If no migration name is provided, EF Core will apply all pending migrations.
- **What Happens**:
    - EF Core connects to the database specified in your connection string.
    - If the database does not exist, it creates it.
    - It creates a special table named `__EFMigrationsHistory` to keep track of which migrations have been applied.
    - It executes the commands in the migration's `Up()` method, creating the tables and relationships.
    - It inserts the seed data you defined in your `DbContext`.


### 4) Verifying the Result

- After running `Update-Database`, you can connect to your SQL Server instance using a tool like SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
- You will see that:
    - The new database has been created.
    - The tables (`Departments`, `Employees`) have been created with the correct columns and constraints (including foreign keys).
    - The `__EFMigrationsHistory` table contains a record for the migration you just applied.
    - The tables contain the seed data you specified.

| **Migrations** | This is the primary mechanism for managing and evolving a database schema in a controlled, versioned, and repeatable way. It's essential for team development and CI/CD. | "I use EF Core Migrations to keep my database schema in sync with my application's data model. It allows me to apply and roll back schema changes programmatically." |
| **`Add-Migration`** | This command is used to scaffold a new migration file based on the changes detected between your current `DbContext` model and the last applied migration. | "When I change my model, I run `Add-Migration` to generate a new migration file. I always give it a descriptive name so it's clear what changes it contains." |
| **`Update-Database`** | This command applies pending migrations to the target database, executing the SQL necessary to update the schema. | "After generating a migration, I use `Update-Database` to apply the changes to the database. This command will create the database if it doesn't exist and then run the migration scripts." |
| **`__EFMigrationsHistory` Table** | This table is automatically created and managed by EF Core to track which migrations have been successfully applied to the database, preventing them from being run more than once. | "EF Core uses the `__EFMigrationsHistory` table to keep a record of applied migrations. This ensures that when `Update-Database` is run, only the new, unapplied migrations are executed." |


# Implementing a Repository with Entity Framework Core

## Overview

This video demonstrates how to replace an in-memory repository with a new repository that uses Entity Framework (EF) Core to interact with a SQL Server database. The key benefit of this approach is that the application's endpoints, which depend on the repository interface, do not need to change. By simply updating the dependency injection configuration, the application can seamlessly switch from using an in-memory data store to a real database.

## Architecture and Strategy

- **Repository Pattern**: The application uses the repository pattern to abstract the data access logic from the API endpoints.
- **Dependency Injection**: Endpoints receive an instance of a repository via an interface (e.g., `IDepartmentRepository`).
- **Switching Implementations**: Instead of modifying the existing in-memory repository, a new repository class (e.g., `DepartmentEfRepository`) is created that also implements the `IDepartmentRepository` interface but uses EF Core for its data operations.
- **Configuration Change**: In `Program.cs`, the dependency injection registration is updated to map the `IDepartmentRepository` interface to the new `DepartmentEfRepository` implementation.


## Implementing the EF Core Repository

### 1) Injecting the `DbContext`

- The new repository class receives an instance of the `CompanyDbContext` via constructor injection. This `DbContext` instance is provided by the DI container, as it was registered in `Program.cs`.

```csharp
public class DepartmentEfRepository : IDepartmentRepository
{
    private readonly CompanyDbContext _context;

    public DepartmentEfRepository(CompanyDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }

    // ... repository methods
}
```


### 2) Implementing CRUD Operations

- **Add**: Use `_context.Add(department)` to add a new entity to the change tracker, then `_context.SaveChanges()` to generate and execute the `INSERT` statement.
- **Delete**: Use `_context.Departments.FindAsync(id)` to find the entity. If found, use `_context.Departments.Remove(department)` to mark it as deleted, followed by `_context.SaveChanges()` to execute the `DELETE` statement.
- **Read (Get All/By Filter)**: Use LINQ to query the `DbSet` (e.g., `_context.Departments.ToList()` or `_context.Departments.Where(...)`). EF Core translates the LINQ query into a SQL `SELECT` statement.
- **Read (Get by ID)**: `_context.Departments.FindAsync(id)` is an efficient way to retrieve an entity by its primary key, as it will first check the in-memory change tracker before querying the database.
- **Update**: First, retrieve the existing entity from the database. Then, update its properties with the new values. When `_context.SaveChanges()` is called, the change tracker detects the modified properties and generates the appropriate SQL `UPDATE` statement.


### 3) Handling Circular References in JSON Serialization

- **Problem**: When entities have navigation properties that create a cycle (e.g., `Department` -> `Employee` -> `Department`), the default JSON serializer can get stuck in an infinite loop.
- **Solution**: Apply the `[JsonIgnore]` attribute to one of the navigation properties to break the cycle during serialization.

```csharp
public class Department
{
    // ... other properties

    [JsonIgnore]
    public List<Employee>? Employees { get; set; }
}
```


### 4) Updating Dependency Injection Configuration

- In `Program.cs`, change the registration for `IDepartmentRepository` to use the new EF Core-based implementation.
- Change the service lifetime from `Singleton` (which is suitable for an in-memory store) to `Transient` or `Scoped` (which is appropriate for a `DbContext` that should not be shared across multiple requests in the same way).

```csharp
// In Program.cs
// Old registration:
// builder.Services.AddSingleton<IDepartmentRepository, DepartmentRepository>();

// New registration:
builder.Services.AddTransient<IDepartmentRepository, DepartmentEfRepository>();
```

- Examine this method:
```c#
public List<Department> GetDepartments(string? filter = null)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(filter))
        return context.Departments?.ToList();

    return context.Departments?
        .Where(x => EF.Functions.Like(x.Name, $"%{filter}%"))
        .ToList();
}

```
- This is the code that runs if a valid filter string was provided.

- .Where(...): This is a LINQ method that filters the data. Entity Framework Core translates this into a SQL WHERE clause.

- x => ...: This is a lambda expression. The x represents a single Department object as the query is being built.

- EF.Functions.Like(...): This is the most crucial part.

- Why not x.Name.Contains(filter)? While Contains works in C#, EF.Functions.Like is a special method that tells Entity Framework Core to translate this directly into a SQL LIKE operator. This is the standard and most efficient way to perform "contains" style searches in a database.

- x.Name: This specifies that the search should be performed on the Name column in the Departments table.

- $"%{filter}%": This creates the search pattern. The % is a wildcard in SQL that matches any sequence of characters. So, "%{filter}%" means "match any text that has the filter value anywhere inside it."

### What Happens in SQL
- To make it even clearer, here's what Entity Framework Core generates behind the scenes:
- If filter is "IT":
- The LINQ query ...Where(x => EF.Functions.Like(x.Name, $"%{filter}%"))... is translated into a SQL query similar to this:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Departments
WHERE Name LIKE '%IT%'

```
- This SQL query will efficiently find all departments where the name contains "IT" (e.g., "IT", "Sales & IT", "COMMITTEE").

| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Repository Pattern with DI** | This combination creates a loosely coupled architecture, allowing you to easily swap out data access implementations (e.g., from in-memory to EF Core) without changing the business logic or API layers. | "I use the repository pattern with dependency injection to decouple my application from the data access technology. This allowed me to switch from an in-memory repository to an EF Core repository just by changing one line in my DI configuration." |
| **`DbContext` Lifetime** | The `DbContext` is designed to be a short-lived unit of work. It should typically be created for each web request. Registering it as `Scoped` or using repositories that are `Transient` or `Scoped` is the standard practice. | "I register my `DbContext` with a scoped lifetime, and my repositories as transient or scoped. This ensures that each web request gets its own `DbContext` instance, which is the recommended practice for web applications." |
| **`FindAsync` vs. `FirstOrDefault`** | `FindAsync` is optimized for retrieving an entity by its primary key. It checks the local change tracker first before querying the database, which can improve performance. | "For retrieving an entity by its primary key, I prefer to use `FindAsync` because it can avoid a database round-trip if the entity is already being tracked by the `DbContext`." |
| **LINQ to SQL Translation** | One of the most powerful features of EF Core is its ability to translate C\# LINQ queries into efficient SQL queries for the underlying database. | "I write my data queries using LINQ, and EF Core handles the translation to SQL. This allows me to write strongly-typed, compile-time-checked queries while EF Core optimizes the database interaction." |
| **Circular Reference Problem** | This is a common issue when serializing object graphs with bidirectional relationships. Knowing how to solve it is a sign of practical experience. | "When serializing related entities, I'm careful to avoid circular reference exceptions. I typically handle this by applying the `[JsonIgnore]` attribute to one of the navigation properties to break the loop." |


# Including Related Entities

### Summary

This transcript explains how to load related data entities in an ASP.NET Core Web API using a technique called **Eager Loading**. The instructor demonstrates how to use the `.Include()` method to fetch a parent `Department` entity along with its child `Employee` entity in a single query. The lesson also covers the necessary adjustments to JSON serialization settings (removing `[JsonIgnore]`) to ensure the related data is included in the API response, and discusses the critical performance implications of using this feature, especially when querying for lists of entities.

***

### Main Points \& Technical Breakdown

#### 1. The Concept: Eager Loading

Eager Loading is the process of loading related data from the database as part of the initial query. In this context, when a request is made to get an `Employee`, the application is instructed to *also* retrieve the associated `Department` data in the same operation.

* **Why is this needed?** By default, navigation properties (like `Employee.Department`) are often not populated to save resources. Eager loading is used when you know you will need the related data immediately and want to avoid making a second trip to the database.

**Diagram: Entity Relationship**

This illustrates the one-to-many relationship where one `Department` can have many `Employees`. The goal is to load the `Department` when an `Employee` is fetched.

```
+----------------+       1..*       +--------------+
|   Department   |<-----------------|    Employee  |
+----------------+                  +--------------+
| DepartmentId   | (FK)             | EmployeeId   |

|                |                  | Department   |  <-- Navigation Property

#### 2. Implementation with `.Include()`

The `.Include()` extension method is used to specify which related entities to load. This is typically done in the repository layer.

**Code Example: Modifying the Repository**

To load the `Department` when fetching a single employee by ID, the `.Include()` method is chained before the query is executed.

* **Note:** The `.Include()` method works with `IQueryable`, which is why the repository method was changed from using `.Find()` to `.FirstOrDefault()`.

```csharp
// In EmployeesFRepository.cs (In-memory repository)

public Employee? GetEmployee(int id)
{
    // Original code (commented out for comparison)
    // return _context.Employees.Find(id);

    // New code with Eager Loading
    return _context.Employees
                   .Include(e => e.Department) // Eagerly load the Department
                   .FirstOrDefault(e => e.EmployeeId == id);
}
```


#### 3. Adjusting JSON Serialization

Even after fetching the data, it won't appear in the API response if the navigation property is decorated with the `[JsonIgnore]` attribute. This attribute is often used to prevent circular reference errors (e.g., `Employee` -> `Department` -> `List<Employee>` -> ...).

To include the `Department` data in the JSON payload, the attribute must be removed.

```csharp
// In Employee.cs model

public class Employee
{
    public int EmployeeId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    // [JsonIgnore] // <--- This attribute must be REMOVED
    public Department? Department { get; set; }
}
```

**Resulting JSON Output:**

After removing `[JsonIgnore]` and using `.Include()`, the API response for `GET /api/employees/1` will change.

**Before:**

```json
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "departmentId": 101
}
```

**After:**

```json
{
  "employeeId": 1,
  "name": "John Smith",
  "departmentId": 101,
  "department": {
    "departmentId": 101,
    "name": "IT"
    // The "employees" list here is likely ignored on the Department model
    // to prevent the circular reference from the other direction.
  }
}
```


#### 4. Performance Considerations (Crucial Point)

While eager loading is useful, it can severely degrade performance if used improperly, especially on collections.

* **Good Use Case:** Getting a single entity with its related data (`GetEmployeeById`). The overhead is small.
* **Bad Use Case:** Getting a list of entities and including related data for every single one (`GetEmployees`).

If you add `.Include(e => e.Department)` to a query that returns all employees, the API will return a large JSON payload with redundant department data. For example, if 10 employees are in the "IT" department, the "IT" department object will be serialized and sent 10 times.

```csharp
// In EmployeesFRepository.cs

public IEnumerable<Employee> GetEmployees()
{
    // AVOID DOING THIS unless absolutely necessary.
    // This is inefficient and returns a lot of redundant data.
    return _context.Employees
                   .Include(e => e.Department) // <-- Inefficient for large lists
                   .ToList();
}
```

The instructor demonstrates this but advises against it, reverting the change for the `GetEmployees` method to maintain good performance. A better approach for lists is to fetch the primary entities first and then let the client request details for a specific entity if needed.

### Key Points for Interviews

This table summarizes the core concepts discussed in the video, which are highly relevant for technical interviews.


| Concept | Key Point \& "Why It's Important" | Potential Interview Questions |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Eager Loading** | Using `.Include()` to load related data in the same database query as the parent entity. It's efficient for preventing multiple round-trips to the database when you know you need the data. | "What is eager loading in Entity Framework? How do you implement it?" <br/> "Explain a scenario where eager loading is the right choice." |
| **Lazy Loading vs. Eager Loading** | **Eager Loading** (`.Include()`) fetches related data up-front. **Lazy Loading** (not shown, but a related concept) fetches related data only when the navigation property is first accessed. Lazy loading can be convenient but can also lead to the **N+1 query problem**. | "What is the difference between eager loading and lazy loading?" <br/> "What is the N+1 problem and how can eager loading help solve it?" |
| **Performance Impact of `.Include()`** | Using `.Include()` on a query for a list of items (`IQueryable<T>`) can cause performance issues by generating complex SQL `JOIN`s and returning large, redundant datasets. It should be used judiciously. | "When should you be cautious about using `.Include()`?" <br/> "How can `.Include()` negatively affect performance when querying a large table?" |
| **JSON Serialization \& Circular References** | The `[JsonIgnore]` attribute is used to prevent the serializer from processing a property, which is a common way to break circular references (e.g., `Employee.Department.Employees...`). Removing it is necessary to expose eager-loaded data in an API response. | "You've used `.Include()` to load a related entity, but it's not appearing in your API response. What's a likely cause?" <br/> "How do you handle circular references when serializing object graphs to JSON?" |
